__This is still a work in progress!__
# Overview
ScalarFlow is neural network engine for scalar valued inputs, named as a spinoff of TensorFlow, (Although the API is closer to PyTorch). It is heavily based off of Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/micrograd/)

### Why I made it
This project is the outcome of me dipping my toes into the work of generative AI and neural networks. It gave me an intuitive understanding of what a neural network actually is, how it works, and how to optimize one (via backpropagation). Turns out that at least in my case, its just some simple math.

### Update: 2024-9-10: I'm working on an example implementation of the library, its a tad harder than expected due to my inexperience, but it should be out soon.
